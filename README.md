# Business Plan

*Note: this repo is here for task keeping only.*

NBusy is an open-source encrypted chat application and server. We want to keep it open-source while having a sustainable business model. Doing so, our primary objectives are:

* Keep our servers and apps trusted.
   
This requires keeping as many components as possible open-sourced. This should maintain proper trust in our work so that people won't have to revert to private deployments for topmost security, while still maintaining the option to do so.

* Maintain a sustainable business.

This always clashes with open-sourcing but is easily doable via maintaining proper licensing model and keeping mass scale dev-ops and related stuff private.

*  Maintain engineering excellence and technical edge.

Having something that is utterly stable and reliable while using cutting edge tech is always a challenge but that is what drives the community to use and improve our software.

And finally:

> The stage is beneath our talent, but we shall elevate it.
